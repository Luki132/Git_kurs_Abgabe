# How to use `git`

1. Initialize a repository with `git init` 
2. Stage your files with `git add .` 
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m "a commit message"`
4. See your history with `git log` 
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout <specific number>` 
6. Create new branches with `git checkout -b <branche-name>` 
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours 1
